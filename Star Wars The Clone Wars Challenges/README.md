## This assignment is a comprehensive exercise in data manipulation, transformation, and analysis, using the context of the Star Wars universe. It involves working with pre-existing datasets, implementing functions for data processing, and using a caching mechanism for API data retrieval, rather than directly scraping data from online sources.

1. Data Sources and Usage: The data used in the assignment is sourced from the Star Wars API (SWAPI), Wookieepedia, Wikipedia, and the New York Times. These sources provide information on characters, episodes, and other Star Wars-related content. The assignment does not involve scraping these data sources directly; instead, you will work with provided data files.

2. Caching SWAPI Requests: The assignment includes a caching mechanism for handling HTTP GET requests to the SWAPI. This is a technique used to store and reuse previously fetched data, reducing the number of direct requests to the API and optimizing performance.

3. Data Processing and Transformation: You will implement various utility functions (in five_oh_six.py) and scripts (in last_assignment.py) to manipulate and process the data. This includes converting data to different formats, handling exceptions, and other data transformation tasks.

4. Focus on implementing utility functions with error handling.
Involve working with a dataset about the "Star Wars: The Clone Wars" animated series, extracting and summarizing information.
Deal with data from New York Times articles about the cultural and economic impact of Star Wars.
Relate to recreating a specific event from the Clone Wars using the provided data, culminating in the generation of a JSON document.

5. Final Output: The culmination of the assignment is to create a JSON document that simulates the escape of the Twilight from the Malevolence, a scenario from the Star Wars narrative. This requires combining different pieces of information and following a specified workflow.
